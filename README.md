# Morf AT - Advanced Forex Software with Self-Learning Features

[![Developer's Site](https://forexroboteasy.com)](https://forexroboteasy.com)

Morf AT is an advanced Forex software developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. This code provides a sample implementation of the Morf AT strategy with self-learning features. Please note that ForexRobotEasy is not the official developer of this product, and this code is only intended to serve as an example of how the product works.

## Overview

Morf AT is designed to assess market movements and make predictions based on user-defined settings. It takes into account the user's deposit, broker, and platform settings to calculate specific parameters and determine the market prediction. The software then executes trade orders based on the prediction.

## How It Works

The main function of the code, `OnTick()`, is called on every tick of the market. It retrieves the user's deposit, broker, and platform settings and calculates the necessary parameters. It then assesses the market movement and predicts the next move. Based on the prediction, it either executes a buy or sell trade, or does nothing if there is no trade opportunity.

The code contains the following functions:

### 1. `CalculateParameter1(double deposit)`

This function calculates parameter 1 based on the user's deposit. The calculation logic divides the deposit by 1000 and returns the result.

### 2. `CalculateParameter2(string broker)`

This function calculates parameter 2 based on the user's broker. The calculation logic assigns a specific value to parameter 2 based on the broker selected by the user. If the broker is not recognized, a default value of 1.0 is assigned.

### 3. `CalculateParameter3(string platform)`

This function calculates parameter 3 based on the user's platform. The calculation logic assigns a specific option to parameter 3 based on the platform selected by the user. If the platform is not recognized, a default option of 'Option C' is assigned.

### 4. `AssessMarketMovement(int parameter1, double parameter2, string parameter3)`

This function assesses the market movement and predicts the next move based on the calculated parameters. The example logic provided in the code checks if parameter 1 is greater than 5, parameter 2 is greater than 1.0, and parameter 3 is 'Option A'. If all conditions are met, a prediction of 1.0 is assigned. If the conditions are not met, it checks if parameter 1 is less than 5, parameter 2 is less than 2.0, and parameter 3 is 'Option B'. If all conditions are met, a prediction of -1.0 is assigned. Otherwise, the prediction remains 0.0.

### 5. `Buy()`

This function executes a buy trade. The logic for executing the trade is not provided in the code and should be implemented according to the trading platform's API.

### 6. `Sell()`

This function executes a sell trade. The logic for executing the trade is not provided in the code and should be implemented according to the trading platform's API.
